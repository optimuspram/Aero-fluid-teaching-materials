        "This python notebook calculates the flow properties for a flow with heat addition (i.e., **Rayleigh flow**). Unlike the normal shock wave case, this calculator calculates the ratio between the properties at a certain Mach number to those of the reference condition (i..e, the sonic condition). Remember that I won't explain the derivation of all the equations. In the following calculations, the gas is an air ($R=287.5$ J/Kg.K, $\\gamma=1.4$), where the $c_{p}$ is calculated by $c_{p} = (\\gamma R)/(\\gamma-1)$. However, you can change $R$ and $\\gamma$ by yourself. \n",
